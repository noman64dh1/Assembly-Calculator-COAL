**Assembly Calculator – COAL Project**

**Overview**
This project is an **x86 Assembly Language Calculator** developed as part of the **Computer Organization & Assembly Language (COAL)** course.  
The program performs various arithmetic and logical operations and displays the output directly on the screen using **video memory**.
**
Technologies Used**
- Assembly Language (x86)
- DOS Interrupts
- Direct Video Memory (0xB800)
- NASM / TASM
- DOSBox

**Features**
The calculator supports the following operations:

- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication  
- Division  
- Modulus (Remainder)  
- Power (Exponential)  
- Percentage  
- Bitwise Left & Right Shift  
- Factorial  

**How the Program Works**
- Clears the screen using a custom `clrscr` procedure  
- Prints text using `printStr`  
- Prints numbers using `printNum1`  
- Uses stack-based procedure calls  
- Displays output at specific screen locations  

**How to Run**
1. Open DOSBox
2. Assemble the file using NASM or TASM
3. Link the program
4. Run the executable
5. View results on the screen
**
Learning Outcomes**
- Understanding CPU registers
- Stack and procedure handling
- Low-level arithmetic operations
- Direct hardware interaction
- Assembly language programming
